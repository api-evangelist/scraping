<p>Data visualization refers to the presentation of data in a graphical format.Traditionally, data visualization has existed in the form of charts and maps.The Periodic Table is one of the best uses of data visualization that reveals hidden relationships and makes the classification of chemical elements easy to understand.Visualizations are a means of encoding ideas/messages such that they can be decoded by someone else easily and insights (both obvious and not-so-obvious ones) can be drawnÂ on the data.Good quality visualizations often reveal some new or fascinating insights upon the underlying data.</p>
