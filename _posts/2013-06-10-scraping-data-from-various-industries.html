We’ve just added several new scraping sessions that exemplify extracting data from sites in various industries. If you go to our home page and click on one of the buttons corresponding to an industry you’ll be taken to a page where you can download the scraping session. The e-commerce section also has a video to walk you through the process, and we’ll be adding videos to the others shortly.Developer CommunityFind more free helpful resources including tutorials, our API, and a forum monitored by our expert staff.» Visit Community</p>
