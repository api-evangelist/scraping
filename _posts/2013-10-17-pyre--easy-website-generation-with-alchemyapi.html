<p>At the recent hackathon at the University of Michigan, MHacks, there were dozens  of applications that were built with the help of AlchemyAPI.One that stood out was Pyre, a website generation app that very quickly builds a basic website.The user simply types in the type of site they would like to build in a free form text box, and Pyre generates the template.Examples include, “build me a marketing website” or “I’d like to start a blog.” The user clicks go and automatically has a template designed for their use case.</p>
