<p>Imagine that you have a lot of samples for a certain kind of data in JSON format.Maybe you want to have a better feel of it, know which fields appear in all records, which appear only in some and what are their types.In other words, you want to know the schema for the data that you have.We’d like to present you skinfer, a tool that we built for inferring the schema from samples in JSON format.Skinfer will take a list of JSON samples and give you one JSON schema that describes all of the samples.</p>
