<p>I’ve blogged for a few years now, and I’ve used several tools along the way.zachbeauvais.com began as a Drupal site, until I worked out that it’s a bit overkill, and switched to WordPress.Recently, I’ve been toying with the idea of using a static site generator (a lá Jekyll or Hyde), or even pulling together a kind of ebook of ramblings.I also want to be able to arrange the posts based on the keywords they contain, regardless of how they’re categorised or tagged.</p>
