<p>Analyzing news headlines across the globe with Kimono and MonkeyLearn
The news is probably one of the first things people check in the morning, but how much does what you know and understand about the world depend on your news source?Will you view the world differently if you head over to CNN instead of BBC?Tools like MonkeyLearn and Kimono allow us to gather and analyze the text we encounter in our daily lives and determine what that text says behind the words – in this case, it turns out that different news sources report on different news with different weighting.We analyzed the front page articles of five different major global news outlets – Fox, CNN, China Daily, Al Jazeera (English), and the BBC.We amassed the data and then used MonkeyLearn’s text analysis, a combination of entity extraction – a process that recognizes text corresponding to important people, places, and organizations – news classification and keyword extraction.</p>
