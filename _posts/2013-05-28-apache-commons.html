Thoughts, tips, and updates on screen-scraping

We’ve recently included libraries for Apache Commons Lang.There is a large number of useful things in there, but I find most use for stringUtils and wordUtils.For example, some sites one might scrape might have the results in all caps.You could: 
name = “GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER”; name = StringUtils.lowerCase(name); name = WordUtils.</p>
