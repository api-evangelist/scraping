<p>When we talk about company culture at AlchemyAPI, we are not referring to the perks we offer like company-paid, twice daily Starbucks runs, team lunch on Fridays, gym memberships, bike rentals, or the breathtakingly awesome downtown office view.We are talking about the people who work at AlchemyAPI and the way they define who we are as a company.Computer science geniuses, modern marketers and sales extraordinaires comprise our energetic team focused on delivering the latest and greatest artificial intelligence capabilities for our customers.Our team members describe us as “clever, inclusive, intellectual, entertaining, innovative, kind, and fun.” Working here offers a challenge, but we conquer it while wearing flip flops and drinking our grande triple lattes.</p>
