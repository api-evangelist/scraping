<p>Tim Sherratt, digital historian, web developer and cultural data hacker whos been developing online resources relating to archives, museums and history since 1993, created TroveNewsBot, a simple script that checks for messages from Twitter, uses those messages to create queries in Troveâ€™s newspaper database, and tweets back the results.He built this using the Trove API, the Twitter API, and AlchemyAPI.For the unofficial story, see, TrovesNewsBot: The story so far.or read notes from a talk he gave at Digital Treasures Symposium, 21 June 2013, University of Canberra, Conversations with collections.How does the @TrovesNewsBot work?</p>
