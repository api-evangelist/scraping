<p>As anyone who has tried working with “real world” data releases will know, sometimes the only place you can find a particular dataset is as a table locked up in a PDF document, whether embedded in the flow of a document, included as an appendix, or representing a printout from a spreadsheet.Sometimes it can be possible to copy and paste the data out of the table by hand, although for multi-page documents this can be something of a chore.At other times, copy-and-pasting may result in something of a jumbled mess.Whilst there are several applications available that claim to offer reliable table extraction services (some free software,so some open source software, some commercial software), it can be instructive to “View Source” on the PDF document itself to see what might be involved in scraping data from it.In this post, we’ll look at a simple PDF document to get a feel for what’s involved with scraping a well-behaved table from it.</p>
