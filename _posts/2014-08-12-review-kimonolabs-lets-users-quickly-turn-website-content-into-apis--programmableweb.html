<p>Kimono Labs is a startup that wants to make it easier for users to extract data from the unstructured Web and expose it as APIs.There are other companies doing the same thing, but, based on my tests, KimonoLabsâ€™ Kimono changes the game like no other product.Kimono allows even users without any prior programming knowledge to extract content from Web pages with just a few mouse clicks, and then expose the content through simple APIs.It is likely a step toward the semantic Web that is expected to speed up the creation of smart applications because it allows even non-techies to get information from different sources and, with the help of a couple more tools, create and put different services in communication.In this post, I will show how I used Kimono to create a simple API from a Web page, and recommend how to put the information provided to a good use.</p>
