<p>The vast majority of my contributions to the web have been loosely encoded in the varyingly standard-compliant family of languages called English.Itâ€™s a powerful language for expressing meaning, but the inference engines needed to parse it are pretty complex, staggeringly ancient, yet cutting edge (i.e.brains).We tend to think about data a lot at ScraperWiki, so I wanted to explore how I can ask data questions of words.</p>
