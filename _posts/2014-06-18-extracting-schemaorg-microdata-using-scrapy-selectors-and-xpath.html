<p>Web pages are full of data, that is what web scraping is mostly about.But often you want more than data, you want meaning.Microdata markup embedded in HTML source helps machines understand what the pages are about: contact information, product reviews, events etc.Web authors have several ways to add metadata to their web pages: HTML “meta” tags, microformats, social media meta tags (Facebook’s Open Graph protocol, Twitter Cards).And then there is Schema.</p>
