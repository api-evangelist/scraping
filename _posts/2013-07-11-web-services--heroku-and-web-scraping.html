<p>I have a nokigiri web scraper that publishes to a database that Im trying to publish to heroku.I have a sinatra application frontend that I want to have pull in from the database.Im new to Heroku and web development, and dont know the best way to handle something like this.Do I have to place the web scraper script that uploads to the database under a sinatra route (like mywebsite.com/scraper ) and just make it so obscure that no one visits it?</p>
