<p>An article that came out at the beginning of 2015 was intended to (quietly) let people know about what Google had been doing to offer a new form of search results called Table Search.The article was titled   	Applying WebTables in Practice (pdf).It tells us about an initiative that Googles structured data team embarked upon, when they started the WebTables project in the second half of the 2000s, which involved them releasing the following paper:
  	WebTables: Exploring the Power of Tables on the Web (pdf) 
  	It got some nice press in the paper   	Structured Data on the Web (pdf).What is Table Search?There are many pages on the Web that are filled with data in the form of tables.</p>
