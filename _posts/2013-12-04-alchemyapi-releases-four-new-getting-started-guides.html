<p>In the on-going effort to make our services easier for our developers to use, we’ve created 4 new getting started with AlchemyAPI guides.These guides are intended for developers, and walk through the required steps to get up and running with AlchemyAPI.Areas covered include getting a key, downloading an SDK, configuring the SDK, and running example code.Since all of our text analysis functions are accessed via a web REST API, we’re pretty agnostic to your programming language choice.So that’s why we’ve created several guides.</p>
