<p>One of our latest case studies describes how NLP helps Pocket, a leader in “save for later” applications, make it easier for their users around the globe to store, enjoy and prioritize web content that caught their attention.Pocket calls on AlchemyAPI’s entity extraction and concept extraction services to process more than 500,000 unique items, and more than 1.5 million items in total, each day.Pocket’s challenge is to pinpoint concepts and entities within saved content and accurately classify text, video and webpages.The problem gets more complex when you consider that 60% of the content doesn’t use English.</p>
