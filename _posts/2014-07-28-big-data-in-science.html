<p>Rapidly making in-roads into the scientific research domain, the potential of big data in advancing research is undeniable.Of course, this is discounting the many codes for specific proteins which would make this number even more fantastic!What has now changed is the magnitude and the scope of data.New-age sciences like the -omics (genomics, proteomics etc.), astrophysics, and   astronomers     in particular, are looking to harness big data and analytics to answer questions long in the dark.</p>
