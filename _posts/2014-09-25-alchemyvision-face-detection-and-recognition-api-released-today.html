<p>Today were announcing the public availability of our Face Detection and Recognition API, the latest addition to the AlchemyVision product family.When provided an image file or URL, the AlchemyVision Face Detection and Recognition API returns the position, age, gender, and, in the case of celebrities, the identity of the people in the photo.Organizations across a variety of industries, such as social media monitoring and advertising, can take advantage of face detection to analyze their unstructured image data.This API provides the ability for applications to glean demographic data from images, which can be useful when analyzing a personâ€™s social media habits or for analyzing which images have the highest return on investment in advertising campaigns.In addition to the general face detection capabilities, an impressive feature of the AlchemyVision Face Detection and Recognition API is its familiarity with well-known entities.</p>
