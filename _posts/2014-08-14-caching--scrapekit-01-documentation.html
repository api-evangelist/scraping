<p>Caching¶ 
Caching of response data is implemented via CacheControl, a library that extends requests.To enable a flexible usage of the caching mechanism, the use of cached data is steered through a cache policy, which can be specified either for the whole scraper or for a specific request.http will perform response caching and validation according to HTTP semantic, i.e.in the way that a browser would do it.</p>
