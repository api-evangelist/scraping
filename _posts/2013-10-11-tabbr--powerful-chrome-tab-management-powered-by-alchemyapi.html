<p>If you’re like most people, after a day of browsing and working on the internet, your Chrome browser can get pretty cluttered with lots of tabs.So many tabs, that you can’t even see the page titles, just the favicons.This of course makes it challenging to find the tab and content that you’re looking for.Enter tabbr, a Google Chrome extension created over the weekend at MHacks, the recent hackathon at the University of Michigan that drew over 1,200 hackers from schools across the country.tabbr is a tab management tool that allows the user to quickly find the tab they are looking for.</p>
