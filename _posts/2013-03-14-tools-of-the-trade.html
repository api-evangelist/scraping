<p>With the experience of a whole week of ScraperWiki, I am starting to appreciate the core tools of the professional Data Scientist.In the past I’ve written scrapers in Matlab, C# and Python.However, the house language for scraping at ScraperWiki is Python.It’s a good choice: a mature but modern language with a wide range of useful, easy to install libraries.As an interpreted language, it is easy to use in a very fast development cycle.</p>
