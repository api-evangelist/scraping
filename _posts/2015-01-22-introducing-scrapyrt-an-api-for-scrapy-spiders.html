<p>Weâ€™re proud to announce our new open source project, ScrapyRT!ScrapyRT, short for Scrapy Real Time, allows you to extract data from a single web page via an API using your existing Scrapy spiders.We needed to be able to retrieve the latest data for a previously scraped page, on demand.ScrapyRT made this easy by allowing us to reuse our spider logic to extract data from a single page, rather than running the whole crawl again.ScrapyRT runs as a web service and retrieving data is as simple as making a request with the URL you want to extract data from and the name of the spider you would like to use.</p>
