<p>With March Madness comes the challenge to predict that perfect bracket, but with the odds of achieving this being something like 1 in 135 billion, a little bit of insider knowledge would definitely help matters.API building platform Kimonolabs has created a March Madness API that aims to help users improve their chances.Understanding that better predictions could be achieved by having access to historical player and game data, and recognizing that there wasnt yet a fully open and well-documented REST API from which to gather this data, Kimonolabs birthed the un(official) March Madness API.Its a full RESTful API that provides historical data on players, teams, conferences and games, as well as up-to-date statistics as the tournament progresses.The API uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate errors, and all responses are returned in JSON.</p>
