<p>GigaOM recently created an article on The Gigaom guide to deep learning: Who’s doing it, and why it matters.It’s a great article that gives an overview of what deep learning is all about, some common applications, startup companies and industry giants that are using it, and the possibilities for future developments.In deep learning, computers learn by creating hierarchical representations using stacked neural network layers.Each new layer creates an abstraction of the layers below to understand more complex ideas.For example, in networks designed to perform facial image recognition, the first layers may detect lines or edges, while later layers are responsible for more abstract reconstructions of shapes, such as eyes or noses.</p>
