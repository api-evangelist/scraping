<p>For the past six years, we have been asking ourselves one fundamental question for our business.NB: This is an analysis by Veit Blumschein, CEO of FromAtoB.After following the old-fashioned way by kindly asking each partner for access to its API, we faced the fact that not all money in the world would suffice to finance this approach.Therefore, we had to make a decision – either we wait for the market to open up for us or we open up the market ourselves, as our own crawling framework enables us to use the best interface every B2C company is offering: their own website.We realized that we actually didn’t need any help from our partners for the integration: no maintained API, no complex security measures, effortful documentation or expensive technical support the partner had to provide us with.</p>
