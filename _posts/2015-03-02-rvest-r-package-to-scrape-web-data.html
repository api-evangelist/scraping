<p>Inspired by the Python libraries RoboBrowser and BeautifulSoup, the rvest package by Hadley Wickham helps you scrape web data via R in a similar way.Parse tables into data frames, navigate around a website, and of course, extract bits from a page.Ill stick to BeautifulSoup, but Im saving this for later.Im sure itll come in handy sooner rather than later.</p>
