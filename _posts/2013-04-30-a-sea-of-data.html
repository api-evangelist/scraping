<p>My friend Simon Holgate of Sea Level Research has recently “cursed” me by introducing me to tides and sea-level data.Now I’m hooked.Why are tides interesting?When you’re trying to navigate a super-tanker into San Francisco Bay and you only have few centimetres of clearance, whether the tide is in or out could be quite important!The French port of Brest has the longest historical tidal record.</p>
