<p>In the world of market research, you can’t avoid the need to understand consumer actions and preferences.That can take a lot of time.In this case study,  BrainJuicer  shows us how you can bypass the amount of time your team spends parsing all of the information for useful signals with natural language processing (NLP).The team at BrainJuicer spends a lot of time determining what intrigues their clients’ audiences and using that information to develop new ideas for products and campaigns that drive revenue.However, it is difficult to figure out exactly what consumers want.</p>
