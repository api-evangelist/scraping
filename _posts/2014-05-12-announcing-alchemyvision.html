<p>We are excited to announce that AlchemyVision, a computer vision platform that combines our core NLP technology with 3D image analysis is available for general use today.In its first release, AlchemyVision includes APIs for image extraction and tagging.Future releases will include APIs for image search.Its safe to say that there is a multitude of unstructured data to be mined from the millions of images shared on the web each day.If you could capture that information and associate it with complex concepts, would that be valuable?</p>
