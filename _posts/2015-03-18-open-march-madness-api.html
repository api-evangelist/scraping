<p>It’s basketball season, and we’re in full March Madness mode here at kimono.As not-so-closeted-nerds, we like to dig into the data behind everything (plus, we’ll do basically anything to win the office pool).But, since there isn’t a fully open and well documented REST API for the March Madness Tournament, we decided to build one.We can’t wait to see what you will build with the March Madness API!Use the data explorer to see which team has the most wins, which player had the highest field goal percentage, which team scored the most points in a single game, and anything else your heart desires.</p>
