<p>New Named Entity Extraction Engine: increased accuracy, new entity types (Anatomy, JobTitle, Degree), wider coverage for several types (City, Companyâ€¦), linked data improvements, and custom entity type support.Disambiguation Improvements: increased accuracy, wider coverage for locations, companies, persons and organizations.Quotations Extraction Updates: improved English quotation extraction, French quotations extraction.As SemanticWeb.com has mentioned in, AlchemyAPI Improves Service Using Deep Neural Networks, in the area of language modelling, we are able to train on huge amounts of data (a hundred billion words or more) in less than 24 hours, which has made the AlchemyAPI service more accurate with more features.</p>
