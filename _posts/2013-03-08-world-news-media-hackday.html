<p>Gl obal news media execs are  gathering in London to discuss the continuing emergence of digital media at WAN-IFRA’s Digital Media Europe 2013 (#DME13) and we’d like to invite you to influence the agenda with a hack day on Saturday 13th April.WAN-IFRA covered the first Knight-Ridder tablet back in 1994.20 years later, publishers are finally breaking with the past—moving from daily print editions to 24-hour digital-first operations with tech savvy journalists able to broadcast direct from mobile devices.As once traditional organisations learn to embrace digital media and become digitally native, they’re becoming more and more data driven.And they’re looking to developers for inspiration.</p>
