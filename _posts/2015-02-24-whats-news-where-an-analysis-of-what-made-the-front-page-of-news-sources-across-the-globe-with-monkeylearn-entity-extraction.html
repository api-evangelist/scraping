<p>It’s probably one of the first things you check in the morning (well, second, after facebook): the News.But how important is the actual source you use to find out about what’s happening in the world?Does it matter if you head over to CNN instead of BBC?As it turns out, different news sources report on very different pieces of news.We analyzed text from all of the articles behind the front page headlines of six different major global news outlets over 3 days.</p>
