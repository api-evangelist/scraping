<p>Here at Scrapinghub we love open source.We love using and contributing to it.Over these years we have open sourced a few projects, that we keep using over and over, in the hope that it will make others lives easier.Writing reusable code is harder than it sounds, but it enforces good practices such as documenting accurately, testing extensively and worrying about backwards support.In the end it produces better software, and keeps programmers happier.</p>
