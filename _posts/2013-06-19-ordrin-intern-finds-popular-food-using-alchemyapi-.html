<p>Ordr.in, the worlds only restaurant ecommerce platform, asks their new interns (Orderinterns) to build anything they want during their first week, as long as it uses their API.Their new intern Michael decided to build something that would simplify menus by limiting the number of items in a menu.He used AlchemyAPI to extract keywords from reviews instead of extracting the entire review text.He used our Python library so that it only took a few lines of code to get the keywords from a text string.</p>
