<p>It’s been several months since we first integrated Portia into our Scrapy Cloud platform, and last week we officially began to phase out Autoscraping in favor of Portia.In case you aren’t familiar with Portia, it’s an open source tool we developed for visually scraping websites.Portia allows you to make templates of pages you want to scrape and uses those templates to create a spider to scrape similar pages.Autoscraping is our predecessor to Portia, and for the time being it’s still available to users who already have Autoscraping-based projects.Any new projects as well as existing projects without Autoscraping spiders will be only be able to use Portia.</p>
