<p>Yesterday a friend of mine linked me to a fictional web serial that he was reading and enjoying, but could be enjoying more if it was available as a Kindle book.The author, as of yet, hasnt made one available and has asked that fan-made versions not be linked publicly.That said, its a very long story and would be much easier to read using a dedicated reading app, so I built my own Kindle version to enjoy.This post is the story of how I built it.Step 1: Source Analysis
