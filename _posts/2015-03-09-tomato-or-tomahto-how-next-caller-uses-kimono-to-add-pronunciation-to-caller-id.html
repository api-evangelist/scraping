<p>Next Caller provides Advanced Caller ID™ to businesses.Across industries, inefficient exchanges between sales/support reps and customers cost $14B annually.With the Next Caller API, unknown inbound phone numbers get matched with relevant background data for the caller, giving reps near-instant access to all relevant data on a customer.Although this adds tremendous value to any customer-facing business, Next Caller did not stop there.They looked to the edges, for truly distinctive customer support and they learned that “the details” matter.</p>
