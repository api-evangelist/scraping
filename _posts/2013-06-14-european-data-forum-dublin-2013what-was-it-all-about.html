<p>It was not an accident that the 2013 European Data Forum was held in Dublin given that Ireland’s presidency of the Council of the European Union runs until June 30th.The venue was Croke Park Conference Centre which over looks Ireland’s premier sporting stadium and an historic landmark.It was organised by the Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI), an internationally recognised body focused on semantic web research.Its purpose is to directly contribute to the Irish government’s plan of transforming Ireland into a competitive knowledge economy.The annual conference brought together data practitioners from industry, research, the public-sector and the community, to discuss the opportunities and challenges of the emerging Big Data Economy in Europe.</p>
