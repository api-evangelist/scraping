<p>This is a guest blog post by Robert Meusel
 Robert Meusel is a researcher at the University of Mannheim in the Data and Web Science Research Group and a key member of the Web Data Commons project.The post below describes a new tool produced by Web Data Commons for extracting data from the Common Crawl data. 
The Web Data Commons project extracts structured data from the Common Crawl corpora and offers the extracted data for public download.We have extracted one of the largest hyperlink graphs that is currently available to the public.We also extract and offer large corpora of Microdata, Microformats and RDFa annotations as well as relational HTML tables.</p>
