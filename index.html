<p>The harvest or scraping of content from web pages is something many do, few discuss that they do, and some feel it is wrong to scrape content witihout permission..</p>
<p>No matter how you feel, there are numerous approaches to scraping data and then deploy an API. It is something many developers find themselves doing to get the data and content they need.</p>
<p>A new breed of scraping tools are emerging that don't just extract datq and content from websites, but also normalizes and deploys API interfaces for integrating with content--proving to be one possible option for deploying APIs at web scale.</p>
<p>This project is meant to understand the various tools and approaches to deploying APIs from scraped data.</p>
